Functional requirements - the project was created in order to apply the newly learned architectural techniques, so it is not strictly
business / user stories that can manage architecture - were invented for the needs of the project

Qualitative attributes - the project is very small and certainly as very small it will end, the architectural drivers that I see here are
certainly configurability per environment, extensibility, security and metrics

Design constraints - the design constraints are the lack of human resources, it will be created by one person, so technologies remain
matched to the knowledge of a person's frameworks and language to focus on development in a known ecosystem (except for frontend, where
presentation layer is at a low level - maybe some mock)

Conventions - no architectural drivers here

Design goals - the prototype will have an H2 base, target development - a relational base
